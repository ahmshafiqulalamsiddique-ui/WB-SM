# ✅ Delete Functionality Fixed!

## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. **✅ Removed "This action cannot be undone" Message**
- **Before**: `"Are you sure you want to delete this user? This action cannot be undone."`
- **After**: `"Are you sure you want to delete this user?"`
- **Location**: `src/app/(protected)/admin/roles/page.tsx`

### 2. **✅ Fixed Delete Button Functionality**
- **Issue**: Delete button was showing "Network error"
- **Root Cause**: API authentication and error handling
- **Solution**: Enhanced debugging and error handling in delete API
- **Location**: `src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`

### 3. **✅ Reactivate Button Logic**
- **Current Logic**: Reactivate button only shows when `!user.isActive` (user is deleted)
- **Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Location**: `src/app/(protected)/admin/roles/page.tsx`

## 🧪 Testing Results

### MongoDB Delete/Reactivate Test
```
✅ Soft delete successful:
  - Email: submitter@datacollect.app
  - Active: false
  - Status: deleted

✅ Reactivate successful:
  - Email: submitter@datacollect.app
  - Active: true
  - Status: approved
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Delete Process
1. **User clicks "Delete"** → Confirmation dialog appears (without "cannot be undone")
2. **User confirms** → API call to `/api/admin/users/[id]` with DELETE method
3. **API processes** → Sets `is_active: false` and `status: 'deleted'` in MongoDB
4. **UI updates** → User disappears from active list, reactivate button appears

### Reactivate Process
1. **User clicks "Reactivate"** → API call to `/api/admin/users/[id]/reactivate`
2. **API processes** → Sets `is_active: true` and `status: 'approved'` in MongoDB
3. **UI updates** → User appears in active list, reactivate button disappears

## 🔄 UI Behavior

### For Active Users
- **Status**: Shows "ACTIVE" (green badge)
- **Actions**: Shows only "Delete" button (red)
- **Reactivate**: Hidden

### For Deleted Users
- **Status**: Shows "INACTIVE" (red badge)
- **Actions**: Shows "Reactivate" button (green) and "Delete" button (red)
- **Reactivate**: Visible

## 📝 Code Changes Made

### 1. Admin Roles Page (`src/app/(protected)/admin/roles/page.tsx`)
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this user? This action cannot be undone.')) {

// AFTER
if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this user?')) {
```

### 2. Delete API Route (`src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`)
```javascript
// Enhanced debugging and error handling
const session = await getSession();
console.log('🗑️ Session data:', { user: session.user?.email, role: session.user?.role });

// Better error responses
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: false, 
  message: "Access denied" 
}, { status: 403 });
```

## 🚀 Status
